Wind Turbine Analysis and Optimization

Description:

Our code features two parts. Part one consists of an analysis of real world turbines gathered from a database. Part two is a wind farm optimization tool, aiming to help in the planning of wind energy farms.
Our main code is not in the main.py file because we thought it was more easily run in two separate files with two separate drivers.
File list:
finalProjectCode.py - Main code for part 1
finalProjectCodePart2.py - Main code for part 2
finalProjectDriverPart1.py - Driver for part 1
finalProjectDriverPart2.py - Driver for part 2
RealWindData2.csv - A collection of wind turbine data


Instructions:
Part 1 needs no instructions, simply run finalProjectDriverPart1

Part two will prompt the user to input to input data
Start by opening finalProjectDriverPart2, press run
When prompted for the desired plot size, insert a number in km (For example: 5,10, 7.8)
Press enter
When prompted for a turbine, enter in the swept area of desired turbine in m2 (For example, 5000, 800)
Press enter
